ANTI PIRACY IDEAS
- Of course hardcore obfuscate. especially the spigotmc.org check stuff.
- Then the check with spigotmc.org method with:
- On start, do check only if server is in online mode, but if it completely fails cause no internet,
  then keep retrying.
- Retry the entire time if the server is still in online mode. on timer
- then if finally you get a connection and response, then delete jar file/or not based on that response.
